```
## Usage
### Open and Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open the Jupyter Notebook file ml_engg.ipynb to explore, modify, and run the machine learning code. This notebook contains the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. You can execute the cells within the notebook to train the machine learning model and analyze the results.

### Run the Machine Learning Script:
After running the notebook and obtaining a trained model, execute the following command in your terminal to run the machine learning script:
```
python3 ml_engg.py
```

###Flask Web Application

To run the Flask web application, use the following command:
```
python3 app.py
```
This will start the Flask server. You can access the application at the following URL in your web browser: 
http://localhost:5000
